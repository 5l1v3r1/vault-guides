This code corresponds to a blog published on medium - Vault Integration Patterns withÂ Venafi

Synopsis:

The integration options for Vault and Venafi appear in the form of Vault plugins, vault-pki-backend-venafi and vault-pki-monitor-venafi.

The pki-backend is a plugin for Vault which allows certificate requests to be fulfilled directly by Venafi on behalf of 40+ CA's. In this model Vault provides the common API for devops teams to perform certificate requests, while the Venafi platform fulfills the request. Since each request for a certificate is fulfilled by Venafi, latency between the platforms should be considered.

The pki-monitor is another plugin for Vault which allows Vault issued certificates to be governed by Venafi policy and auditing capabilities. The plugin can monitor Vault issued certificates when Vault operates as an intermediate or root CA. For this discussion, Vault will function as an intermediate CA from an internal root Microsoft CA. If you are familiar with the native pki engine in Vault, the workflow to setup and operate the pki-monitor plugin is similar. The added benefit with this approach is that policy is centrally defined in Venafi, downloaded to Vault during plugin setup and enforced during the certificate generation request to Vault without the added latency of Venafi fulfilling the request. Auditability is maintained via Venafi on any certificate generated by Vault.
