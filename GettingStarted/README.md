# Getting Started

For many of the guides within this repository, we rely heavily upon Vagrant and Terraform.  

Vagrant is most often used to launch virtual machines in a local workstation environment. Please see the [Vagrant Getting Started Guide](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html) to learn more about Vagrant if you are unfamiliar.

Terraform is widely used for managing resources in cloud environments. Similarly, there is a [Terraform Getting Started Guide](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) that helps people become familiar with that software.

## What Guides Are Available?

### HashiStack
The [HashiStack](hashistack) directory contains code to bring up a minimal instance of the HashiStack. That is, it is a single virtual machine running Consul, Vault and Nomad.
